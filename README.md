## Repository Setup
you have to add **git** to the first line of code to initalize the directory and can only be done once
then you'll have to `mkdir` to to add a new repo and the you `cd` into that repository which gets you out of your workspace
and then you `pwd` to see in which repo you are in at the time
once you finish with any line of code ou have to `Git add README.md` to add it and then ~ Git Commit -m  "README~ to save your work
every time you finish and then you keep repeat in for a **NEW REPO** in a new project you may be doing and it saves automatically in your remote (c9.io)
