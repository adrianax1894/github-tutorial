## Git vs. GitHub
**Git** is a version control: keep”snapshots”of code   
  **GitHub**  stores code in the cloud  and visually track changes   
   ### Git  | Github
_doesn't include github_ | _Includes Git_

## Initial Setup
**For Initial Setup**  
 ** 1) To sign up for Github you need to [visit github] (http://www.github.com) > Sign up and it will ask for a ** **Username** and make if you have an Hstat google account then use it if not use
 a username you'll remember. then create a **pasword** same as your hstat .org password if not something that you'll remember.
 **Beaware that if you get a red bubble just keep working and ignore it**, _CLICK ON FREE ACCOUNT_ AND YOUR FINISHED SIGNING UP !!!
   A `SSH` key is used to copy a url and can be used for cloning and forking.
**Git Config** is only done once so that the cloud (github) remembers in which email to save it to. 
I.E; git config --global user.name "First Last" and then 
git config --global user.email "username@hstat.org"
and that is about it.

## Repository Setup
you have to add **git** to the first line of code to initalize the directory and can only be done once
then you'll have to `mkdir` to to add a new repo and the you `cd` into that repository which gets you out of your workspace
and then you `pwd` to see in which repo you are in at the time
once you finish with any line of code ou have to `Git add README.md` to add it and then ~ Git Commit -m  "README~ to save your work
every time you finish and then you keep repeat in for a **NEW REPO** in a new project you may be doing and it saves automatically in your remote (c9.io)


---
## Workflow & Commands
**Git status** is to see which files you have edit since your last commiting
be aware that it's your choice to do it or not.
when you add you have to write it  like so ;
`git add README.md` , this adds your readme to the folder then , you have to `git commit -m "README"`
to save that change and your edits after you have to `push` your work yo the cloud so people can see it and my push back to do changes.
